# CPTP
- This tool can help you if you want to follow friends who have better Codeforces ratings than you. You can get a list of problems that your friend has already solved by each category. Then you can sort them in ascending/descending/count order. You can input your Codeforces handle to check which problems you have already solved from all of your friend's solved problems. If you want to solve any unsolved problems and get stuck, you can ask that friend for help!
